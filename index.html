		        <h3>Biography and career</h3>
			    <article class="tribute-article">
		        <strong>Louis Thomas Hardin</strong> (May 26, 1916 – September 8, 1999), known professionally as 
				<strong>Moondog</strong>, was an American composer, musician, performer, music theoretician, poet and inventor 
				of musical instruments. Largely self-taught as a composer, his prolific work widely drew inspiration from jazz, 
				classical, Native American music which he had become familiar with as a child, and Latin American music. 
				His strongly rhythmic, contrapuntal pieces and arrangements later influenced composers of 
		        minimal music, in particular American composers Steve Reich and Philip Glass.<br><br>
			    
                <p id="tribute-article">Due to an accident, Moondog was blind from the age of 16. He lived in New York City from the late 1940s until 1972, 
                during which time he was often found on Sixth Avenue, between 52nd and 55th Streets, busking, selling records and 
		        performing poetry. Regularly appearing in a cloak and a horned helmet, he was recognized as <strong>"The Viking of 
				Sixth Avenue" </strong>by thousands of passersby and residents who were not aware of his musical career.</p> <br><br>

                <h3>Music</h3>
		        <article class="tribute-article">
		        In the process of establishing himself as a composer, Moondog drew inspiration from a wide variety of styles of music. 
				His first works were immediately inspired by the music of pow wow gatherings that he had attended as a child; 
				as his career progressed, his music encompassed influences from bebop, swing, rumba, modernism and Renaissance music. 
				It was characterized by what he called "snaketime" and described as "a slithery rhythm, in times that are not ordinary [...]
				I'm not gonna die in 4/4 time". Many of his works, triumphant and dramatic in tone, were highly contrapuntal, 
				including many big band arrangements, and he also incorporated counterpoint techniques. In the 1950s, 
				he also began to incorporate city sounds such as subway trains and foghorns into his work, inspired by his experiences 
				busking.

 		        <h3>Inventions</h3>
		        <article class="tribute-article">
		        Moondog invented several musical instruments, some of which were played on studio albums or in live performances by him 
		        and his subsequent ensembles. They include the <b><em>"oo"</em></b>, a small triangular-shaped harp, a larger harp which he named the 
		        <b><em>"ooo-ya-tsu"</em></b>, and a triangular stringed instrument played with a bow that he called the <b><em>"hüs"</em></b> (after the Norwegian "hus", 
		        meaning "house"). His best known instrument is the <b><em>"trimba"</em></b>, a triangular percussion instrument that the composer invented 
		        in the late 1940s. The original trimba is still played today by Moondog's friend Stefan Lakatos, a Swedish percussionist, 
		        to whom Moondog also explained the methods for building such an instrument.
